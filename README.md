# Fate-App
Fate-App to be use with Fate Core and Fate Accelerated pen and paper rpg settings.

The app consists of two activities:
- the first activity has two Buttons - the first opens the second activity and the second button goes to the Fate SRD Webpage.
- the second activity is a fragment activity with three tabs:
1st Tab- a simple fate dice roller with four imageview's to represent the dice.
2nd Tab - fate accelerated approaches that can be set with spinners and then rolled to show the result.
A Toast message shows the dice result while the result TextView shows the final result with the approach rating.
3rd Tab - works on the same principle as the 2nd tab, but instead of 6 approaches you have the core skills of the Fate Core rules =)
